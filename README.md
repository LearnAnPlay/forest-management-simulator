Improve infrastructure: Spend money to enhance forest health and public support.
Conduct wildlife surveys: Spend money to boost public support and gather valuable data.
Educate the public: Spend money to significantly increase public support.
Save money: Conserve resources for future use, increasing your funds slightly.
Harvest resources: Convert forest health into money by selecting how much to harvest.
